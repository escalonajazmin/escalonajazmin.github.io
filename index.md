### CPSC 120

Lab 10: The main thing I liked the most about this lab 
was the fact that we got to use 2d vectors to orginaize 
Californias popultion based on each county. It was the 
first lab I got to do asyncronusly so it was difficult 
at first to start it off and get some momentum going. 
Once I had momentum going the lab wasn't too hard to 
firgure out but I liked how challenged I felt not only 
because the lab was a bit difficult but also because it 
was done asyncronusly.

Lab 11: My favorite part about this lab was that I got to 
create a simple number guessing game. This lab was really 
fun to do since one of my goals is to develop a game. The 
object oriented portion of the lab also helped me better 
understand how classes work in code and how to utilize them 
better.

Lab 1: This lab is my favorite because even though it is a 
simple introduction to vs code and c++ in genereal I like 
how easy it was to understand. I like how we got to initialze 
our terminal and vs code to start coding. I also liked how 
got to incorporate Git Hub right in the beginning.
